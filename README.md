# IntroToProgramming-Final
My project is a sports betting calculator that will use data to predict the outcome of a certain NFL player’s receiving yards based on the prop line. To use it, the user will enter the player’s exact name, but capital letters don’t matter. Then, the user enters the line from any sportsbook. 
What the program does is it looks at what the given player has done each week up until now and compare it to the given line. The programs 'prediction', over or under, is whatever the player has done more often over this season.
